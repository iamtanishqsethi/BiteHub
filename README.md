# Routing in web apps

- client side routing(single page app) - the one we are using <Link> , we are not rendering/reloading the page every time page changes , it has all  the pages loaded the very first time page was loaded it does not make any new network call
- server side routing - it fetches the html page from the server side and reloads/renders  the whole page , traditional way
